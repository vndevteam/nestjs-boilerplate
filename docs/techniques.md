## Backend Frameworks

We utilize the following frameworks for our backend development to create scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building web applications and APIs.

## Development tools

Our development process is supported by a suite of tools designed to enhance productivity, enforce code standards, and streamline the development workflow.

- **Pnpm**: A fast, disk space efficient package manager for JavaScript that helps in managing project dependencies.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, used for writing scalable and maintainable code.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript code.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.
- **Husky**: A tool for managing Git hooks, used to automate tasks like linting and tests before commits.
- **Commitlint**: Ensures that commit messages meet the conventional commit format.
- **Commitizen**: A command line tool for formatting commit messages according to conventional commit standards.
- **Lint-staged**: A tool for running linters on staged git files, ensuring only clean code is committed.
