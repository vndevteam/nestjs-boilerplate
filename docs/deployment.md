## Prerequisites

- Access to the production server
- Necessary credentials for database and other services
- The latest version of the application code

## Steps

1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Ensure the production server is running and accessible.
   - Verify that all required software is installed on the server.

2. **Upload the Application**:
   - Use SCP or FTP to transfer the application files to the server.
   - Place the files in the appropriate directory.

3. **Configure the Application**:
   - Copy the `.env.production` file to the server, if applicable.
   - Update any environment-specific configuration settings.

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Create the production database, if not already set up.
   - Run migrations and seed the database with any necessary data.

5. **Start the Application**:
   - Depending on the application, this might involve starting a web server, a background job processor, etc.
   - Ensure that all services are running as expected.

6. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Access the application through its public URL to ensure it's running correctly.
   - Check application logs for any errors or warnings.

7. **Monitor the Application**:
   - Set up monitoring and alerting tools to keep track of the application's health and performance.

## CI/CD Pipeline

// TODO: Add details on setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

## Rollback Plan

In case of any issues, have a rollback plan ready:

- Keep the previous version of the application ready for deployment.
- Ensure database backups are taken before the deployment, to restore if necessary.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will help ensure a smooth deployment process. Always test thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production.
